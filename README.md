# 133a Robotics Final Project

For this problem, we are considering a simulated environment where there are obstacles (e.g. rocks) falling vertically. The robot being used is a redundant snake arm. The robotic snake arm has to perform the following tasks :

- Avoid the obstacles hitting its body.
- Touch a random target (e.g. a colored cube) in the workspace, with the correct gripper orientation.
- If initially entangled in a loop, it has to untangle itself and then repeat, the above mentioned tasks.
